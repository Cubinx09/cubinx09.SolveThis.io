# Can You Solve This?
Fifth project for the Athena Awards.

Instead of just pure HTML and CSS, one of my web projects finally has javascript in it! Although its a bit rudementary...

This time around this is a questionnare. 5 questions, each with different choices that fall under; correct, incorrect, or the funny answer. Click on the button, and a popup will appear telling you which one you chose. It's very basic, I must admit, but it's something!

Since it's the first project for this hackathon that uses javascript, naturally, implementing the JS was the hardest part. Making the JS work with the html modals was pretty hard to wrap my head around, because although you don't need to make seperate modals for each question, you needed a different variable to make the popup appear and the close button to even work. I'm not really sure what I have to do to have not have that many variables in a JS file, but it works as is so it's fine. HTML, besides making the modals work and the buttons look fine, was a bit of a walk in the park. CSS probably the second hardest part because although you have to use it if you want to do any sort of customization for a webpage, I don't have enough knowledge of CSS to make it look cool or sleek or just overall stylish and that's a bit of a bummer. 

Either way this project is huge progress in terms of my web development skills. Which is good!!

Overall this project took about 8 hours.
